Smart contract based supply chain management

The development of a smart contract-based application will come in layers. The approach here would be to begin with generic smart contracts that fits the needs of various industries and applications. As we advance, the focus will shift towards one specific application – this will enable us to iron out more granular details and incorporate more complex functionalities specific to that industry. 

In general, the decentralized application will be able to execute the following functions:

•	Track the flow of goods from material providers all the way to retailers. This step can be expanded to capture a broader network of participants operating at various tier levels. The complexity of the network is tentative for now. 
• Execute payments upon fulfilling conditions. Conditions can include, predetermined lead times, date of transaction, digital identity of the approver. The transactions will be processed using Ether.
•	Keep an open ledger of transactions for parties to access


The following are proposed elements of a supply chain based smart contract (these are subject to change)

•	Costs of manufacturing, sale price, service fees and charges 
•	Transaction amounts (can be pre-set prior to releasing funding from escrow)
•	Lead times - time scales for manufacturing, shipping time etc. 
•	Penalties – (i.e: if product delivery is delayed by “x” amount of time, additional charges/deductions may be applied)

Tools and Packages that may become necessary for this project:

o	Remix – browser-based IDE 
o	Solidity – connect to the Ethereum Virtual Machine  
o	Ganache – local development blockchain, connect to ganache the same way you would with the Ethereum main network. 
o	Node Package Manager (NPM) – configure environment to develop smart contracts
o	Truffle Suite packages – tools to develop, deploy and migrate smart contracts  
o	Metamask Ethereum Wallet – browser extension for managing an account 
o	HTML, CSS, and JavaScript will be used for testing and front-end development
